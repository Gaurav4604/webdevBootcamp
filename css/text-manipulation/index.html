    <h1>Cuttlefish</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>
        Cuttlefish or cuttles[2] are marine molluscs of the order Sepiida.
        They belong to the class Cephalopoda, which also includes squid, octopuses, and nautiluses.
        Cuttlefish have a unique internal shell, the cuttlebone, which is used for control of buoyancy.
    </p>
    <p>
        Cuttlefish have large, W-shaped pupils, eight arms, and two tentacles furnished with denticulated suckers, with
        which they secure their prey.
        They generally range in size from 15 to 25 cm (6 to 10 in), with the largest species, Sepia apama, reaching 50
        cm (20 in) in mantle length and over 10.5 kg (23 lb) in mass.[3]
    </p>
    <p>
        Cuttlefish eat small molluscs, crabs, shrimp, fish, octopus, worms, and other cuttlefish.
        Their predators include dolphins, sharks, fish, seals, seabirds, and other cuttlefish.
        The average life expectancy of a cuttlefish is about 1â€“2 years.
        Studies are said to indicate cuttlefish to be among the most intelligent invertebrates.[4]
        Cuttlefish also have one of the largest brain-to-body size ratios of all invertebrates.[4]

    <h2>Fossil Record</h2>
    <p>
        The earliest fossils of cuttlefish are from the Cretaceous period.
        [6][7] represented by Ceratisepia from the Late Maastrichtian-Paleocene.
        [8] Whether the earlier Trachyteuthis is assigned to this order, or to the Octopodiformes, remains unclear.[9]

    <h3>Cuttlebone</h3>
    <p>
        Cuttlefish possess an internal structure called the cuttlebone, which is porous and is made of aragonite.
        The pores provide it with buoyancy, which the cuttlefish regulates by changing the gas-to-liquid ratio in the
        chambered cuttlebone via the ventral siphuncle.
        [21] Each species' cuttlebone has a distinct shape, size, and pattern of ridges or texture.
        The cuttlebone is unique to cuttlefish, and is one of the features that distinguish them from their squid
        relatives.
